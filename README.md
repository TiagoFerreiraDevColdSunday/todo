1. CLI Todo App (Easy)

Overview:
Create a command-line interface (CLI) application that allows users to manage a simple to-do list.

Key Features:

    Add, remove, and list tasks.

    Save tasks to a file (e.g., using JSON or a simple text format).

    Parse command-line arguments (using a crate like clap).

Learning Outcomes:

    Get comfortable with Rust syntax, basic data structures, and error handling.

    Work with file I/O.

    Understand Rust’s ownership model and borrowing rules.


--------------------------

2. Async Chat Server (Intermediate)

Overview:
Develop a basic asynchronous chat server that multiple clients can connect to. This project introduces network programming and concurrency in Rust.

Key Features:

    Accept multiple client connections using asynchronous programming.

    Broadcast messages from one client to all connected clients.

    Manage client connections with proper error handling and cleanup.

    Utilize libraries like Tokio for async runtime and serde for message serialization (if needed).

Learning Outcomes:

    Dive into asynchronous programming and concurrency.

    Learn about network programming (TCP/UDP).

    Manage shared state safely across threads using Rust’s concurrency primitives.

3. Simple 2D Game Engine (Advanced)

Overview:
Build a basic 2D game engine that can render graphics, handle user input, and manage game entities. This project is more complex and will push your understanding of Rust’s systems programming capabilities.

Key Features:

    Render graphics using a library such as ggez or Piston.

    Create a game loop that updates game state and renders frames.

    Handle user input (keyboard, mouse) and collision detection.

    Implement resource management for assets like images and sounds.

Learning Outcomes:

    Apply advanced concepts like real-time rendering and game loops.

    Explore Rust’s ecosystem for multimedia and graphics.

    Learn about performance optimization and low-level systems programming in Rust.# todo
